# PLA-using-Movie-Data
This project uses the Perceptron Learning Algorithm (PLA) to classify movie data based on violence levels and critics' ratings. It constructs a linear decision boundary, analyzes convergence, and evaluates iterations for optimization. Developed in RMarkdown, it showcases the application of machine learning concepts to practical datasets.
